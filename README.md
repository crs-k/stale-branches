# Stale Branches

Finds and deletes stale branches. By default it aligns with [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/viewing-branches-in-your-repository) definition, but can be configured for other use cases.

When a branch has been inactive for more than the `days-before-stale` input, it is considered stale. The branch will be deleted once it has been inactive longer than `days-before-delete`.

* By default, a stale branch is defined as a branch that:
  * has had no commits in the last 120 days.
  * has no protection rules.
  * is not the default branch of the repository. 
  * See [inputs](https://github.com/crs-k/stale-branches#inputs) for more info.
* See [example workflow](https://github.com/crs-k/stale-branches#example-workflow).

## Usage

### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repository's `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs
Inputs are defined in [`action.yml`](action.yml). None are required.:

| Name | Description | Default |
| --------------- | ---- | --- |
| `repo-token` | Token used to authenticate with GitHub's API. Can be passed in using [`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret). | [`${{ github.token }}`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context) |
| `days-before-stale` | Number of days a branch has been inactive before it is considered stale. | 120 days |
| `days-before-delete` | Number of days a branch has been inactive before it is deleted. | 180 days |
| `comment-updates` | A comment with updated information will be added to existing issues each workflow run. | false |
| `max-issues` | This dictates the number of `stale branch üóëÔ∏è` issues that can exist. Also, the max number of branches that can be deleted per run. | 20 |
| `tag-committer` | When an issue is opened, the last committer will be tagged in the comments. | false |
| `stale-branch-label` | Label to be applied to issues created for stale branches. <br>**As of v2, this _must_ be unique to this workflow**. | `stale branch üóëÔ∏è` |
| `compare-branches` | This compares each branch to the repo's default branch. <ul><li>When set to `info`, additional output describes if the current branch is ahead, behind, diverged, or identical to the default branch.<br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26232872/157590411-7c97806c-a509-4002-b7a5-a1e4a5da08eb.png)</li> <li>When set to `save`, this prevents branches from being deleted if they are ahead of or diverged from the default branch.</li> <li>When set to `off`, no additional calls are made.</li></ul> | off |
| `branches-filter-regex` | An optional Regex that will be used to filter branches from this action. | '' |
| `rate-limit` | If this is enabled, the action will stop if it exceeds 95% of the GitHub API rate limit. | true |
| `pr-check` | If this is enabled, the action will first check for incoming/outgoing PRs associated with the branch. If a branch has an active pr, it will be ignored. | false |
| `dry-run` | If this is enabled, the action will not delete or tag any branches.	| false |
| `ignore-issue-interaction` | If this is enabled, the action will not interact with Github issues. | false |

### Outputs
Outputs are defined in [`action.yml`](action.yml):

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `stale-branches` | List of all branches identified as stale during a workflow run. |
| `deleted-branches` | List of all branches deleted during a workflow run. |

#### Terminal Output Groups
* Output is grouped by branch.
  * Active branches are green
  * Stale branches are yellow
  * Dead branches are red
  * Skipped branches are blue
